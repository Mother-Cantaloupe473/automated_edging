# automated_edging
Creating a costumizable and automated edging experience for BlueTooth toys.

I'm trying to create an application that allows for a customizable and automated edging experiaece using https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-py.

Before creating an the application some research on how exactly the human body reacts to certain stimulus
in order to create working and effective algorythms.

For now I'm searching for information on the internet but i think some more user data will be required for this to work.
I might do some surveys/data collection using some selfmade python-programs i will upload on this githup in order to gather the data.

If anybody wants to support this project or got some ideas feel free to message me. Im not that advanced in math nor programming so things
might take a little while to get developed but I'm trying my best!
